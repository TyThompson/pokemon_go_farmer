# This is an autohotkey bot to farm Pokeballs
Why? I'm bored, can't sleep, and enjoy automating tasks.

* How to setup Pokemon Go on PC with Bluestacks emulator: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2Ev2RMCLM0
* Autohotkey download: www.autohotkey.com

Don't roam faster than physically possible otherwise you will be softbanned.

When launching the Autohotkey use the help > WindowSpy function to get the coordinates of the Pokestops you wish to use.

#To Do:
Work without active window (Bluestacks + Autohotkey limitation?)
Catching Pokemon (crashes in Bluestacks)
Hatching Eggs (crashes in Bluestacks)
